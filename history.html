          Georgia, with diverse landscape and climatic zones, is distinguished
          by the existence of about 500 endemic grape varieties. Grape varieties
          differ from one another in terms of regions and micro-zones. The
          following regions may be distinguished due to their wine
          characteristics: Kakheti, Kartli, Meskheti, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi,
          and the Black Sea.Georgia is one of the richest countries in water
          resources. Water plays a significant role in the production of certain
          spirits. Georgian whiskey, chacha, and brandy enriched with Caucasian
          water have a special taste.

          It is quite natural to gather these important events or artifacts in
          one small country, considering the fact that the discovery of ancient

          dates back to 1,800,000 years.

        The etymology of Georgian surnames is often connected with various
        historical events, conditions,origins ... The surname Chkhaidze is
        connected with the grape «Chkha» as well as with the sun. Chkhaidze is
        also mentioned as the savior of Georgian grapes and is related to the
        following wine varieties: «Chkhaveri»; «Chkhaberdzula». Jimsher
        Chkhaidze’s ancestor, Antimoz Chkhaidze, was from the village of Askani
        in Guria. Since 1882 he has been mentioned as a special winemaker who
        tried to take his name outside the borders of Georgia. Constantine, the
        youngest son, tried to continue his work and passed on the tradition of
        making wine as a relay to his grandchildren: Gocha, Zurab, and Jimsher.
        Thus, Jimsher Chkhaidze is a representative of the fourth generation of
        the family of great traditional winemakers.
