            Georgia is a country with a rich culture and history. The oldest
            wine samples were found on the modern territory of Georgia, which
            dates back to 8000 years, therefore, the culture of wine in the
            world has spread from Georgia.

            Georgia, with diverse landscape and climatic zones, is distinguished
            by the existence of about 500 endemic grape varieties. Grape
            varieties differ from one another in terms of regions and
            micro-zones. The following regions may be distinguished due to their
            wine characteristics: Kakheti, Kartli, Meskheti, Imereti,
            Racha-Lechkhumi, and the Black Sea.Georgia is one of the richest
            countries in water resources. Water plays a significant role in the
            production of certain spirits. Georgian whiskey, chacha, and brandy
            enriched with Caucasian water have a special taste.
