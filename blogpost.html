        Georgia is a country with a rich culture and history. The oldest wine
        samples were found on the modern territory of Georgia, which dates back
        to 8000 years, therefore, the culture of wine in the world has spread
        from Georgia.
      </p>
      <p>
        Georgia, with diverse landscape and climatic zones, is distinguished by
        the existence of about 500 endemic grape varieties. Grape varieties
        differ from one another in terms of regions and micro-zones. The
        following regions may be distinguished due to their wine
        characteristics: Kakheti, Kartli, Meskheti, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi,
        and the Black Sea.Georgia is one of the richest countries in water
        resources. Water plays a significant role in the production of certain
        spirits. Georgian whiskey, chacha, and brandy enriched with Caucasian
        water have a special taste.
      </p>
      <p>«it Is not a biological fact, it is a will, to be Kartveli.»</p>
      <p>
        When we plan to go for a wine tasting experience and choose the winery
        to visit, most of the time we choose a dreamy estate lost in the Italian
        or French countryside, surrounded by green hills or in the middle of
        endless vine rows. Have you ever thought of going for a wine tasting in
        urban vineyards? If you do not believe that there are wineries very
        close to famous city centres around the world, then you need to read our
        new blog post where we share with you our favourite wineries located
        near some incredible cities.

        A great experience of this trip was getting to visit Melville Vineyards
        and Winery with winemaker Chad Melville. The winery has become a
        benchmark for quality in the Sta. Rita Hills with Chad describing his
        winemaking style as the following, “The vineyard speaks, not the
        cellar.” Cool climate Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Syrah, something so
        easy sounding can be astonishingly hard without the proper execution but
        Melville wines excel with minimal cellar intervention or additions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Melville started in 1989, drawn to the cool climate of the Sta. Rita
        Hills, and now they own more than 100 estate acres with 16 clones of
        Pinot Noir. This vineyard diversity allows for more options for the
        winemaker to create with, providing differences in intensity or
        highlighting specific fruit flavors. Some clones are better at battling
        fungal disease as they offer more space between grapes in the cluster
        while some planted are actually more prone to viruses. This can be seen
        as beneficial to some producers as fruit ripening slows from less
        efficient photosynthesis, allowing grape maturity to catch up to
        ripeness. This was experienced in Napa Valley in the 70’s with fan leaf
        virus in some vineyards, helping create a leaner and not as jammy fruit
        quality that helped define the style of that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Melville Estate Chardonnay has yellow apple and salty pineapple brine
        flavor and aromas, round and tropical yet vibrant and refreshing, cool
        climate California Chardonnay at its best. If you prefer more citrus
        zest and less tropical flavor the Melville Inox Chardonnay, which is
        French for stainless steel, is wonderful with sea sprayed lemon and
        light stone fruit. Melville Pinot Noir bursts from the wine glass, a
        fantastic example of what whole cluster inclusion can add to a wine.
        Some common aromas and flavors of their Pinot Noir include rose petal,
        hibiscus flower, blood orange and dried herb black tea. The 2016
        Melville Donna’s Syrah is one of my favorite Californian examples of the
        grape, made with 100% whole cluster inclusion, with savory prosciutto
        aromas along with salty viscous blueberry.

        Port wine is making a comeback. If you’re a wine lover, you’re probably
        familiar with Port wine but if you’re new to wine, it’s time to get
        acquainted with Portugal’s best stuff. It’s a delicious type of wine
        that goes with so many foods (and it’s also great on its own, of
        course!). But just like other types of wines, there are some specific
        foods and flavors that pair best with Port, and all its styles. So, in
        this post, we’ll cover Port wine pairing with sweet foods and Port wine
        pairing with savory foods.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re a wine newbie and you don’t know what Port wine exactly is,
        don’t worry – before we explain Port wine pairing, we’ll cover what Port
        wine even is. Let’s get into it.

        In the most basic terms, Port wine is a sweet, usually red, fortified
        wine that comes from the Douro Valley wine region of Portugal. It is
        made from dozens of different grape varieties but dominantly Tinta
        Barroca, Tinto Cão, Tinta Roriz (Tempranillo), Touriga Francesa, and
        Touriga Nacional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortified means that during the fermentation process, while the wine is
        being fermented, a grape-based spirit is added to it to strengthen the
        wine. That makes the wine sweeter and boozier.
      </p>
      It’s often served as a dessert wine, and in most cases it’s dark red.
      However, it can be white, and it can also come as dry or semi-dry.

        One of the ways to serve Port is with savory foods. It goes great with
        charcuterie boards, nuts, cheeses, and olives, but also with main dishes
        such as meat, sushi, and surf & turf. If you want to serve your Port
        wine with savory foods, here are some ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This delicious pairing can be consumed as an appetizer, a stand-alone
        snack, or after your meal. The citrusy, nutty, and fruity White Port
        goes perfectly with the salty potato chips and olives, and the nutty
        flavors of your favorite nuts.
      </p>
      The bright notes of Port go so well with the combination of seafood and
      meat, and they balance each other out so well. Opt for a Ruby Port to not
      overwhelm the flavors.
